p5.js with matter.js Examples
=============================

Examples showing how to combine [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/).


The examples have been derived from the course Programmiertes Entwerfen (Sketching with Code) @ the [HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd](https://twitter.com/hfggmuend_x/) by Benedikt Groß.

Some of the examples are based on the [matter.js demos](http://brm.io/matter-js/demo) and [p5-matter](https://github.com/shiffman/p5-matter) by Daniel Shiffman.

It is also highly recommended to watch the [Introduction to Matter.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urR596FsU68&index=21&t=0s&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6akvoNKE4GAxf6ZeBYoJ4uh) videos by [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) to complement the examples here.
